        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Client</strong><br>
                <p>As a client I think things went ok. I gave my lead dev everything they needed.
                    My wireframe was ugly but they did a decent job with it. 
                    We communicated over email and it worked fine. In the end I 
                    think the site wasn't very pretty but that could be my fault 
                    because of the color schemes I gave him. If I had to do this 
                    again I would use an actual program for my wireframe and choose
                    better colors.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lead</strong><br>
                <p>Communicating with my client was easy. She sent a very detailed
                    wireframe so I didn't have to make any decisions on my own. I 
                    emailed by junior devs and let them know what their roles are
                    but they never did anything on their pages. Publishing the site 
                    with GitHub was easy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Junior 1-Winters</strong><br>
                <p>Working on the site for Winters was really easy. The lead dev got
                    his header and footer done quickly and I got my page done quickly
                    as well. There was one time they force pushed a change that messed up
                    my stuff but GitHub is a magical place so it didn't cause any problems 
                    in the long run.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Junior 2-Vaclaw</strong><br>
                <p>The site for Vaclaw didn't go as smooth. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>General Experience</strong><br>
                <p>This is what happened with Junior 2</p>
            </li>
